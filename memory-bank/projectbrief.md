# Project Name

UniNotes â€” Academic PDF and Note Sharing Platform

## Background & Problem Definition

University students typically have to store their lecture notes and academic papers on different platforms or share them through social media groups. This creates challenges regarding document quality, accessibility, and editability. Existing solutions are often limited to either PDF sharing or note-taking features. Collective collaboration, real-time editing, and rich content creation capabilities are insufficient.

## Project Summary

UniNotes is a platform that aims to combine PDF upload/viewing, Notion-like note creation, collective work, and interaction features in a single ecosystem. Students and academics can easily share their documents, co-create content with other users, and manage their academic work in an organized manner.

## Goals & Objectives

**Increased Efficiency**: Enable students to access lecture notes, summaries, and shared PDF documents from a single source.

**Content Richness**: Encourage users to become active content creators, not just PDF consumers, through a Notion-like rich text editor.

**Real-Time Collaboration**: Provide an ideal environment for projects and group work by allowing multiple users to make simultaneous edits on collective notes.

**Community & Interaction**: Create an academic community with comment, like, and sharing features; increase interaction and knowledge flow.

**Analytics and Tracking**: Make metrics like most popular content and most contributing users trackable by providing basic statistics for users and administrators.

## MVP Scope

The following features represent the core MVP functions that will definitely be implemented in the platform's first version:

**User Management** â€” Membership, login/logout, profile information (university, department, class). Simple profile page and user statistics.

**Note Upload & Viewing** â€” PDF file upload, tagging (course, topic, etc.), and integrated PDF viewing.

**Notion-Like Note Writing** â€” Block-based rich text editor; adding headings, lists, tables, code blocks, images, and embedded content.

**Discover Feature** â€” Discovering trending notes/documents, department/course-based filtering, and search function.

**Interaction System** â€” Liking, commenting, adding notes to collections.

**Collective Work** â€” Notes open to collaborative editing and real-time collaboration; versioning and contribution statistics.

**Library Management** â€” Collections where users can organize content they've saved or uploaded.

**Notification System** â€” Notifications for comments, likes, and updates from followed users.

**PDF-Note Integration** â€” Taking notes on PDFs, creating rich notes by quoting from PDFs, exporting notes as PDFs.

**Basic Analytics** â€” Analysis of note views, likes, comments, popular content.

## Success Criteria

- Students regularly sharing PDFs and notes
- Increasing number of collaborative note editing and interactions between different users
- Improvement in the quality and diversity of notes produced on the platform
- Feedback collected in the early version contributing to the platform's sustainability and adoption

## Progress and Expansion Opportunities

Once the MVP phase is completed, UniNotes' scope can be expanded with additional developments such as gamification (badges, levels, scoring), advanced analytics (learning analytics, course success correlation), and mobile application.

This Project Brief provides an overview of the project and clarifies which goals should be prioritized during the MVP phase.
